# Student_Database

So at the moment it doesn't use files cuz still tryna get into that without getting awfully confused on that topic so any help on that topic no matter hpw small is always appreciated!!!


1. Alright so in this project we ask the user for the number of people we want to add into the database(kinda like an array).
2. Then what we do is create the things in a normal registration form ask for the students name first and last year of study.
3. Next is we generate the ID for the student.
4. Then what we will do is offer a bunch of courses for the student to register into 
5. Sadly there is only a limited space in the classrooms left so ye gib warning that it is full.
6. Then what we do is basically find the value of the fees for the student to pay.
7. We then ask how much would he like to pay then when he does we kill him
8. Then we just show the status and information of the student
